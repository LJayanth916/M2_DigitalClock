# M2-Embedded_DigitalClock

## Introduction

This is an user digital clock project developed from zero.The clock marks hours, minutes and seconds, using an ATMEGA328P microcontroller.
The clock starts marking time from 00:00, in the moment that it's powered. To adjust time until desired hour and minute you have to use the circuit push buttons (in the right side of microcontroller). We have two push buttons, one to increment hours and another one to increment minutes.
