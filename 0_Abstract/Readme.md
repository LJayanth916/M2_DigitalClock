Digital Clock using ATMEGA328
Introduction
This is an user digital clock project developed from zero.The clock marks hours, minutes and seconds, using an ATMEGA328P microcontroller. The clock starts marking time from 00:00, in the moment that it's powered. To adjust time until desired hour and minute you have to use the circuit push buttons (in the right side of microcontroller). We have two push buttons, one to increment hours and another one to increment minutes.

Features
Displays Time in hours and Minutes.

Should not get reset when turned off.

Should be able to macth the timezones as required.
